## Part 1: Defining The Products Table

1. Open model.py and create the products class (Table). Make sure to include at least 5 attributes of your choice (i.e. price, quantity, description).

2. Open the terminal, navigate to your folder from the terminal (cd y2l...) then run **databases.py**.
If you open the folder you can notice that there's a new file called **lecture.db** in which all the data is stored (Your database).
Go to the terminal again and run **python print_database.py lecture.db**. this command prints your database where you should see the table that you've recently created.

3. Show your work to an instructor or a TA.

## Part 2: Database writes
### 2.1 Creating objects

1. Create a function in **databases.py** that adds a product to the database.

2. Call this function to add your first object to the database.

3. Run **databases.py** then print the database using this command line **python print_database.py lecture.db** to check if you successfully added the object.


### 2.2 Deleting from a database 

1. Create a function in **databases.py** that deletes one product of your choice.

2. Call this function.

3. Run **databases.py** then print the database using this command line **python print_database.py lecture.db** to check if you successfully deleted the product.

### 2.3 Updating objects

1. Create a function in **databases.py** that updates 2 attributes of a product from the database.

2. Call this function.

3. Run **databases.py** then print the database using this command line **python print_database.py lecture.db** to check if you successfully updated the product.

### Extra: Add a maximium for price
If a user tries to create (or update) a product with a price that's more than "300", throw and error saying that the price is too high

## Part 3: Database Reads

1. Create a function in **databases.py** that gets the first product from the **Prodcuts** table in your database **and returns it**.

2. Call this function and **print** the product.

3. Run **databases.py** and check whether it printed the object or not.

4. Now that you have the basic CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) functions fully working, copy the models.py and database.py files to the folder last week's flask lab. Change the app.py file to import functions from databses.py and display the details about the **first** product in the database in **"shop.html"** page.
(Guide: in **model.py** file, in the routing function for **"shop.html"** use the retrieve function to get the product, and then pass it to the html page.)

5 Now, instead of displaying only the first product make it display **all** the products. Note that you need to deal with lists this time. Good luck.


### Extra: Displaying Images
Congratulations! If you reached this phase of the lab then you're doing great. Since you are so smart and a database expert now, add an attribute called image to the Product model and have your product details page from last lab display the product's image


### Extra: Displaying The Products
Create a search box in your page that allows you to search a product by it's name.
Extra extra: make your search work if the user provides only the first part of the keyword. (Exampel if user write "key" and there's a product with name "keyboard" a result should be returned)
